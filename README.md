cookbooks
=========

These cookbooks are written for me to use on Gentoo and Debian installs
(as they are what I use most often)

No attempt has been made to make these portable, as my Ruby knowledge sucks.

Scripts
-------

bootstrap/ - contains bootstrap scripts suitable for 'knife bootstrap --distro'
